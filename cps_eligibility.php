                <p class="no-margin" style="text-align:justify">CPS admits kids from LKG to Grade IX and XI during the academic year, as the school believes in principle that in order to mould a child, according to the expectations of the school and the parents as well, it is necessary that the child has to possess a strong foundation in various skills which the child can learn with certain amount of ease during the primary levels itself. Children from varied background having their base in a school elsewhere may take longer time to gel with the products of CPS and hence admission to Grade VII upwards is normally not entertained ..</p>


<p class="no-margin" style="text-align:justify">For the academic year 2018-19, kids seeking admission for LKG must have been born between 1.4.2014 to 31-03-2015. And for UKG the child must have born between 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2014 and Grades I and above accordingly. Kids seeking admission for LKG are expected to possess the basic toiletry skills as a pre-requisite.</p>

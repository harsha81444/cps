The major emphasis of CCE is on the continuous growth of students ensuring their intellectual, emotional, physical, cultural and social development and therefore will not be merely limited to assessment of learner scholastic attainments. It caters the positive and constructive experiences recommended to promote and enhance learning abilities and emerge as holistic individuals.</p>
